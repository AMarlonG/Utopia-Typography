            <h1>Fluid Typography</h1>
            <p class="intro-text">This page is a short presentation of the fluid responsive work done by Utopia. It consist of a joint design and developer goal for minimal and elegant design, which streamlines collaboration between designers and developers, and ensures visual harmony and consistency. A true embrace of the ebb and flow of the internet.</p>

        <section class="responsive">
            <h2>Responsiveness</h2>
            <p>A website with no CSS is responsive by nature. This is what is referred to as intrinsic responsiveness. The
                advent of different screen sizes made fitting content for these differences a high priority. This is what's
                called responsive web design. This has for a long time, and still does mean defining breakpoints and the use
                of media queries in CSS code.</p>
            <p class="resize">Resize the browser window to observe the transition.</p>
        
            <div class="layout">
                <p class="intrinsic">I'm a text, but I don't use any responsive coding in CSS. I'm what's called intrinsic.
                </p>
                <p class="media">I'm the most common text, and I rely on different media queries to define breakpoints.</p>
                <p class="utopia">I'm also a text and I use Utopia calculations to fluidly transition between screen sizes</p>
            </div>
        
            <p>The main differences is that (1) the intrinsic font never changes size, while (2) the media queries have distinct hard breaks, while (3) the Utopia text fluidly transitions between font sizes.</p>

        <section class="scaling">
            <h2>Scaling</h2>
            <p>By choosing six values, a min and max, for screen width, font size and scale step, the computer is trusted to calculate the fluid transition of scaling. </p>
            <p class="resize">Resize the browser window to observe the transition.</p>
            <div class="steps">
                <p class="step4">This is the biggest font</p>
                <p class="step3">This is almost the biggest font</p>
                <p class="step2">This is a smaller font</p>
                <p class="step1">This is the smallest font</p>
            </div>
            <div class="values">
                <p>Screen width: 320px – 1400px</p>
                <p>Font size: 16px – 22px</p>
                <p>Scale step: 1.25 – 1.333</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="design-development">
            <h2>Design and development</h2>
            <p>The Utopia principles will hopefully simplify the work flow for designers and developers. Designers don't have to design for several breakpoints, and can trust the computer to automatically calculate "the feel" of the design regardless of screen sizes. For developers this process will in many instances mean just one line of code, <code>font-size: var(--step-1)</code> after using the calculations available on the Utopia website. Minimal and elegant code, trusting the ebb and flow of the internet.</p>
            <p class="link">All the complicated maths behind the Utopia principles can be found on <a href="https://utopia.fyi/">the Utopia website.</a></p>
